My 9-5 job start at 6AM but I don't have to work right away so there's a lot of morning I just wake up as a habit and don't know how to continue the morning. Having enough of that, today I am facing myself this question: what should I do when I wake up when there's nothing urgent?

Well, the first thing I can think of is to breath. Keep the air in and out and sync with it to get prepared for the incoming wave of thoughts. Breathing is just as anything fundmental, it is kinda boring at first but as you understand it it get more interesting. I wonder if there is a professional breathing contest in the world, the video editor of that show have to put in huge effort to make the show feel as dramatic as normal shows we are seeing.

And the first not to do thing in general is browsing socials. That feels like a emotion lottery and I would rather take it when I am desperate fixing a hard bug not starting off my day. Just like this morning, I was mindlessly scroll in the hope of find some good meme but I found out a Reddit user have cancer, some ads and self-promotion,.. It is not Reddit's fault, it just how things are these days. I am not that spritual but sitting doing nothing, feeling things around and noticing your inwards is a much rewarding and safer path I can take comparing to randomly consuming whatever the Internet feed me.

To be honest, I don't think I can quit browsing social - it is the new cocain, especially with the new short videos feature.
