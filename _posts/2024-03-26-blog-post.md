There has been a theory on how ideas spread all over humanity based on the gene theory that explain how biology inheritance work and it is surprisingly called with a familiar name: the meme theory. It goes like this: turn out idea is a supernatural creature that chose our brains as their habitat, they are driving our thoughts and actions ever since, deciding what we should spend energy and time on for their own sake. Through human, ideas spread on other brains and some of them become immortal. Some bright stars in the memebiz you already know and host: capitalism, individualism, hiphop, stoicism,... just to name a few. Its reasoning has become our motivation to live and willing to do whatever it takes to serve the idea, no matter if it drains we all the way to bottom. As the book "Sapiens" by Yuval pointed out,humanity has evolved in a way that is not towards our well beings but rather than creating a conveninent for some ideas to thrive on: it has never been easier for meme to invade onto minds with the help of Internet and AI help convert ideas into plan and actions in a eye blink. The pattern that we observe between human and cows repeat when it comes to between ideas and human - we are just cattle to these metaphysical parasites. Or should I say, gods.

Knowing that's the rule is set, there's literally nothing we can do to change the game. Human with all the constraint in our biology and society, has signed a permanent contract to ideas to serve them throughout 3000 years and no sign of stopping in foreseenable future in exchange for more civilized people on Earth with grandiose achievements like GDP, going to space, houses and cars, etc...  just like the cow need to be chopped off into steaks so that the owners can rake in profit and raise more cows that give more buttery, softer meat the next season. Meanwhile, my "free will", "anarchist" memes and their other peers living on my brain are not so happy when they find out about my findout so they called me in and are offering a compromise: they are giving me a chance to cultivate my own parasites so that I can help them protect the territory. 

Here is me, reporting live from the Pentagon.

"Well.. now that your friends tell you to look up and look for us, here we are. But the sad news that there is nothing you can do to change your lower position, the hardest resistance would be to kill yourself but we can all agree that it is worth trying, right? So here's the deal for a dilligent servant like you: help me breed more idea of my kind - the most suitable bosses you will ever have. Take some of my child memes and raise them in your garden, make them your brain's native residents. Teach them the most efficient way to harvest your time and energy and which evil memes that every residents have to be cautious and alert your whole body to stay away - memes we all know too well about its destructive impact and rotten aftertaste like porn, alcohol, violence and ego. Just like human, not all memes are the same. "Good" memes can also destroy you if they are too prevalent and dictate the whole land so keep the diversity - my descendants need them or else they would become psyop. It is important that you accept this path asap before you are filled with memes that just want to take something from you instead of building you."

"That sound like a plan, but how can I teach your children meme? I don't think they will listen to me given your higher status."

"Just be ready. Memes can learn from human the way human learn from bird to make airplane and from fish to make vessels. Some memes like "Compassion" has rooted for centuries after it learnt the ability to love unconditionally from human while "Hate" constantly been on the other side of the river because it getting fed on human's ignorance. But to raise my child is not a simple task and I can not give them to the mediocre, they can not live in a land with no nutrition so show up everyday and do the gardening. On the other hand, even in too good condition my memes can eat you up - I don't want that to happen so adopt more "Compassion" memes - their parent raised them right. There is not an exact todo list because human are supposed to think and imagine - that's the very reason we picked you over dogs. But yeah.. I said it, this is a rewarding path but of course challenging and somewhat dangerous because you will be objectively blind if you pick any memes to be your filter for the reality. Remember: no memes is good enough to make you blind."

"Which reward? What is in it for me then? What do I get from this? Afterall, to raise your memes is as expensive as raising my son, as you already hinted I would have to go places, listen, observe and get my hands on different sets of ideas called "Culture" while wake up everyday telling myself not to get too deep into consumerism where all the exploiting memes are lurking, keep mastering my craftmanship and most important of all: under any circumstances, choose love. Well, now that I laid that all out.. that is not so bad. But it is HARDDDD! Why do I need to do that for you? I will still be your cattle, right?" 

"Well.. our relationship won't change, I will keep being your master. That's more like a role I have to act rather than  decision that I made just like you do not get to choose if you are a human or a god or a pig. However powerful I am and much as I appreciate you, I have my limit. I can not turn you into a meme as much as I can not turn you into a pig this lifetime. "Cattle" is an unnecessary harsh word, I would recommend the word "disciple" - that's more poetic and bring more harmonization. Talking about your son, he will keep serving us like everybody else but at least you raise better bosses for him."

"Give me a moment, I am thinking"

"Let's explore and enjoy the world together while we are still here. That's an order, not a suggestion."
