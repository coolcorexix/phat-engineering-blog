is memorable and hardest to digest though.

This year I started out the year wishing that I would travel more and shuffle up my life given that 2024 has been a pretty defensive year. I and wifey took our son first to her hometown and we got invited to a farm by a friend. The idea was simple: get there and have a big meal with lots of relatives and friends. But as I was expecting all along, we would have to prepare everything including catching a big fish in the pond using net, kill and cook. I never think it would be such stressful. By the time the fish got chopped into ingredients for 3 meals, I almost throw off. 

First is to fish the fish, we started out by using a fishing rod. But I seen this scene too many time, the rod is not just an attempt to catch the fish, it was an ultimatimum - either one of the fish catch the rod or heavier punishment will be used on them. No surprise, later than that a fishing net was brought to the scene.

It was 3 men who dive in and began to surround the fish. As they went 50% of their way, the fish could not hide her existence anymore and it was then me and my son saw it for the first time. It was big and shiny, as big as my son and the sunlight reflect the glow all over her. She jump out of the water, hoping that she can pass the net. But no luck, the jump officially get her tangled in the net.

The net closed down and my friend pull her out of the water. We came closer to take a look - the fish already bleeded due to struggling in the net. Her eyes was rolling everywhere, looking for who did this to her. It is not hard to tell that she was having a problem breathing once out of the water, but sadly she still survived until that time. I wish she could have died before all the next things dawned on her poor meat.

She was big, again, so very resilient, a splash from her can tilt an adult. So they keep her wrapped around the net, put her in the basket and bring her uphill to the kitchen. My friend laid her on the concrete ground when everyone gathered around, admiring on her size. Then his mom said: "Someone bash its head then I will handle the rest". But the most veteran chief of our age also took a step back because of the guilty feeling. Looking back, I wished I could step up at that time to give the fish a gentle and definite death but I honestly did not how to. "Alright, let me do it myself then" the mom, who also the farm owner, came closer. Now I knew what that culted machette is used for. She bat that heavy thing on the fish's head, I can tell that the fish was really hurt as it splashed intensively and blood are streaming out of both gills. She did bat 2 or 3 times more after that, everytime it hitted, the sound thudding yet crumbling sound just turned me upside down, I can feel that the fish's skull is helplessly trying its best to keep the fish's brain intact but it was a tragedy that at this point that any attempt to keep herself alive is just extending the miserable seconds before her end. After the fourth batting, the fish stopped moving and her eyes stop rolling neither. Blood was running thickly on the ground.


Another first time I saw a tool to remove scales from fish skin. Aunties was a professional, she had done this way many times. Scale was coming off like dandruff from my head. But as I was checking on the fish, I saw that she was still gasping for air. Oh poor little creature, why are you still here? What still kept you here with all that smashed skull, gill and scale and paddle all cutted off. Why dont't you just die? I can not breath normally when seeing this, I feel like it is an offense to the fish that I still stay intact while watching her suffer like this. I felt like there were an old tree falling on my chest as the fish was still alive.

The fish is big so her head is big too. So big it did not fit the cooking pot. Aunties needed somebody to help her split the head in half. I was waiting for this all along, I am not afraid of hurting her anymore - she already at her worst so any attempt to end her right now is, I can not find a better word but I know it is not right, forgivable. I was assigned a blade to keep it centered while the lady knock the machette on it to make a cut strong enough to split the skull in two. I was focused and got things done. I did it for me, to escape from the turburlence growing inside me and also to verify my involvement of her suffering. At least to me, it is more self-acceptable than being a bystander seeing all of that happening in front of you without doing anything.

I carried on to chop the fish into slices, could not do much because it was digusting so I shared the work with a friend. Cooking is just so deceptive and magical at this point when it convert a whole terrible and brutal process into fun and euphoria at the later half with all the seasoning and grilling. Staring on a black screen that keep staring back at me, I had to confess that I was lowkeyly looking for this occasion all along. I want to get a taste of a full process so that I really know how much a meal with meat cost. I tried stay lifelong vegan frequently but deepdown I knew I need more extreme measurement, especially in the case of an atheist. It is tiring conversation about the ethnic of the carnnivorve but let's save it for another day.
